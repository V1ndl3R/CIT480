This week I have been super busy with work and have barely worked on the Ansible playbooks.  I am just starting with it at this moment.  
Ansible seems to be very simple but I have not been able to get it working.  I can understand the strength of it, since it will automate
many tasks which is very useful.  I am not sure if it will be my go-to for automation but I really like that we are being exposed to so many different 
programs and services.  I think this is a strong approach to this class as it will really get us ready for working in an actual job in this field.
Since this class requires us to learn a new service every week, we will likely be able to adapt to many different situations.
I was able to complete the 3rd lab easily.  Prometheus seems like a nice and easy to use interface.  I feel like it will be useful 
in later labs.  I liked that you could access Prometheus through a web interface it made it easy to use.

This week I also signed up for AWS and was able to get my student credit very easily.  I also setup a two-step verification, this give me a little
easy of mind.  I am really looking forward to possibly being able to get the AWS certs.  I think those are important certs to have at the 
moment since many employers are looking for candidates that have them.
