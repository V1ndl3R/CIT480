How to Secure Your Wi-Fi Network
Securing your Wi-Fi network is crucial to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access. Here’s how to lock down your network.

Step 1: Change the Default Router Credentials
Log in to your router’s admin panel (usually at 192.168.1.1) and change the default username and password.

Step 2: Use WPA3 or WPA2 Encryption
Ensure your Wi-Fi is using WPA3 (or WPA2 if WPA3 isn’t available). Avoid outdated protocols like WEP.

Step 3: Set a Strong Password
Create a complex Wi-Fi password with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information.

Step 4: Enable Network Encryption
Enable encryption in your router settings to secure data transmitted over your network.

Step 5: Disable WPS
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) can be a security risk. Disable it in your router settings.

Conclusion
By following these steps, you can significantly enhance the security of your Wi-Fi network and protect your data from unauthorized access.
