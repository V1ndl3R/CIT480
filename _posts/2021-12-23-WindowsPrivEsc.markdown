Standard path for Windows privledge escalation is:
1. Gain an initial foothold ie. standard account access
2. Enumerate account privileges and resources it can access
3. If the system will allow it run automated scripts ie. winPEAS or PowerUp.ps1
4. If automation does not work try to manually find and path to Administrator
