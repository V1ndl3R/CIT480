How to Perform a Basic Vulnerability Scan with OpenVAS
Vulnerability scanning is a critical step in maintaining a secure network. OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is a powerful, open-source tool for identifying security vulnerabilities in systems and applications. In this guide, I’ll walk you through the process of installing, setting up, and running your first scan using OpenVAS on Kali Linux.

What Is OpenVAS?
OpenVAS is a suite of tools that performs vulnerability scanning and management. It’s part of the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) framework and offers both free and enterprise-grade options. OpenVAS allows security professionals to identify vulnerabilities in devices, servers, and applications, ensuring they're addressed before attackers can exploit them.

Step 1: Install OpenVAS
On Kali Linux, OpenVAS can be installed directly from the default repositories. Begin by updating your system and installing OpenVAS:

bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvas
Once installed, initialize OpenVAS with the setup command:

bash
sudo gvm-setup
This process configures the services, downloads the latest vulnerability database, and sets up a default admin account. Make a note of the admin credentials displayed after the setup completes.

Step 2: Start OpenVAS Services
After installation, you need to start the OpenVAS services:

bash
sudo gvm-start
To check the status of the services, use:

bash
sudo gvm-check-setup
Ensure all components are running correctly before proceeding.

Step 3: Access the Web Interface
OpenVAS provides a user-friendly web interface to manage scans and view results. Access it through a web browser by navigating to:

https://localhost:9392
Log in using the admin credentials provided during the setup process. If you’re accessing the interface remotely, replace localhost with your server's IP address.

Step 4: Add a Target for Scanning
Once logged in, the first step in running a scan is to add a target:

Go to Configuration > Targets.

Click New Target and enter details such as the target’s name and IP address or hostname.

Save your configuration.

Step 5: Create and Run a Scan Task
With your target configured, you’re ready to create a scan:

Navigate to Scans > Tasks and select New Task.

Fill in details, including the task name and the target you created earlier.

Choose a scan configuration, such as "Full and Fast" for comprehensive scanning.

Click Save, then Start Scan to initiate the task.

Step 6: Monitor the Scan Progress
As the scan runs, you can monitor its status in the Scans > Tasks section. Once complete, OpenVAS will generate a detailed report.

Step 7: Review the Results
OpenVAS reports provide a wealth of information about discovered vulnerabilities, including:

Severity Levels: Vulnerabilities are categorized as Low, Medium, High, or Critical.

Details and Recommendations: Each finding includes a description of the issue and remediation steps.

Affected Hosts and Ports: Helps pinpoint where the vulnerability exists.

To access the report, go to Scans > Reports and select the completed task.

Step 8: Take Remedial Action
After identifying vulnerabilities, take steps to mitigate them:

Apply security patches and updates.

Disable unused services and ports.

Harden configurations based on best practices.

Conclusion
Regular vulnerability scans are vital for identifying and mitigating potential risks in your environment. With OpenVAS, you have a powerful tool that simplifies the process, giving you detailed insights into your security posture. By following this guide, you’re well on your way to keeping your systems secure and resilient against emerging threats.
