This week I am going to setup a home VPN server using wireguard which is marketed as a simple
to setup and easy to use VPN server.  First will will need to install wireguard and for this 
demo I am using Ubuntu 20.04, run the command:

	sudo apt install wireguard

Next we will complete the public and private keys, first we will make sure that only the correct
user will be able to read the keys:
	
	cd /etc/wireguard
	umask 077
	wg genkey | tee server_priv_key | wg pubkey > server_pub_key

![Keys](https://v1ndl3r.github.io/CIT480/assets/wg-1.PNG "keys")
	

Next we will enable some firewall rules using ufw. This is not needed if you are only connected on your home network.
	
	ufw allow 22/tcp
	ufw allow 51820/udp
	ufw enable
	ufw status verbose


Next we are going to set up the wireguard interface, this is completed in four commands:

	ip link add wg0 type wireguard
	ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev wg0
	wg set wg0 private-key server_priv_key
	ip link set wg0 up
	

Next you can view your new wg interface with either:

	wg
	ip addr

Next we will add the peers to each other with this command, the first line is just an example of the needed information:
	
	wg set wg0 peer <peer public key> allowed-ips <Private IP you set> endpoint <Public IP>:<port set>
	wg set wg0 peer zQOSkB/pkfYNDnli7JXEN7FmOAvCEtUM0Ca5vtCaxF4= allowed-ips 10.0.0.1/32 endpoint 192.168.1.2:51820
