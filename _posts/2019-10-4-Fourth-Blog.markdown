This week I setup my AWS account and created a new repo for our group project.
I had my first experience with using github projects which seems very simple to use. I like how easy it is to create tasks and show what has been completed on them.
It is a nice interface not as flashy as others but it works well and it very easy to setup and utilize.
I also purchased a domain through AWS which was also easy and painless to due, I started creating a group homepage with html/css.  I mostly took a w3schools template and added some info about our team, this is just so there is something up there.  I have not uploaded it to the domain or anything of those tasks.  I plan to get with my group and finalize that this Saturday in class.  I am truly hoping that one of my team members really wants to create the ansible playbook.  i am not looking forward to that aspect of this project.  

I am still working through all the kinks with github and pulling and pushing from command line.  It is not super difficult I just do not always get the same result when I perform the same command.

This week I also created a simple project that I got from hackerboxes.com.  It is a pretty simple project where you do some simple soldering on a premade pcb.  You attach a few programmable LCD's and buttons to create a mini simon says game.  It was my first time soldering but it seemed to fairly easy to complete.  You also have to program a tiny84 chip with and arduino.  This was also pretty straight forward and worked when I tried it.  I have a few other projects from them that I hope to complete in the following weeks.

I am also trying to make a Raspberry Pi arcade table or cabinet but I have not had much time to complete or work with it yet.  I am hoping to create a bar table with arcade controllers on either side so people can play against each other.  I have received all the components but have not found a table to anything to install them into.  I hope to find something that will work for this project soon as well.
