How to Use Hydra for Password Cracking
Hydra is a fast and flexible tool for brute-forcing passwords. Hereâ€™s how to use it responsibly for testing.

Step 1: Install Hydra
On Kali Linux, Hydra is pre-installed. To install it manually:

bash
sudo apt install hydra
Step 2: Identify the Target Service
Determine the service you want to test (e.g., SSH, FTP). For example, to test SSH on a specific IP:

bash
hydra -l username -P /path/to/wordlist.txt ssh://target_ip
Step 3: Use a Wordlist
Hydra requires a wordlist for password attempts. Kali Linux includes rockyou.txt:

bash
/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
Step 4: Analyze Results
Hydra will display successful login credentials if it finds a match.

Conclusion
Hydra is a powerful tool for testing password strength. Always use it ethically and with permission.
