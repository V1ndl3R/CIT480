This is my blog for the third week of Senior Design.  I am still trying to get Jekyll working correctly.  I think I am finally
getting close it has been quite and adventure.  I attempted to install Kali on my Laptop as a dual boot and even though I 
made sure to install in on a seperate hdd from my windows it still somehow erased it.  So this week has been spent trying to 
get everything back to normal.

Everything now seems to be up and running the way it was but I had to start from scratch which was not ideal in the second
week of the semester.  I had a few labs for each class and I had to remake them basically over night.  I learned that my blogs
were not posting the way that I thought they were when I saw a classmates page.  I now believe I have made Github work with 
my local files.

Jekyll seems like a pretty intresting system but I feel it is more difficult then just creating a Website in HTML.  It would
also be nice if you know we made a site in one of our other classes that then could be used in this class.  Like if the department
was working up together to get us students to the same end point.

Right now it just seems like many teachers are just teaching the same class just with a different title.
