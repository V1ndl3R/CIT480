This is my first blog for CIT480.  This was full of new experiences, as I have never used Docker nor have I used Github pages/Jekyll.

So, so far it has been full of fun trying to set this all up in a Windows environment.  I first tried to set it up using Ubuntu using 
VirtualBox which I believe is now broken as Docker and VirtualBox can not be ran on the same machine.  I also had to upgrade my version 
of Windows from Home to Pro.  I am not entirely sure I see the benefits of utilizing Docker over just SSH into Towhee and just creating 
our own Websites blogs / labs there.

To me it seems as though the entire CIT/CS department changed directions in my final year.  I am not sure if this is correct but I do 
not like not having access to my VM's that I created years ago just to complete this class.  Perhaps I will see the light in the next few weeks.
