This is my first blog for CIT480.  This was full of new experiences, as I have never used Docker nor have I used Github pages/Jekyll.

So, so far it has been full of fun trying to set this all up in a Windows environment.  I first tried to set it up using Ubuntu using 
VirtualBox which I believe is now broken as Docker and VirtualBox can not be ran on the same machine.  I also had to upgrade my version 
of Windows from Home to Pro.  I am not entirely sure I see the benefits of utilizing Docker over just SSH into Towhee and just creating 
our own Websites blogs / labs there.

To me it seems as though the entire CIT/CS department changed directions in my final year.  I am not sure if this is correct but I do 
not like not having access to my VM's that I created years ago just to complete this class.  Perhaps I will see the light in the next few weeks.

I can start to see some of the advantages of using Docker. I am still not completely sold on
it just yet.  But working with it a little more I can see how it has its advantages.  I ended
up just partitioning my hard drive and installing a copy of Kali so that I can still use its 
features.

This week I worked a little bit with creating a dockerfile to make an image.  This would allow
you to be able to create as many containers as quickly as you wanted. This is a very useful
feature and was pretty easy to do.  With the initial lab when I did it step by step the 
only part that I had some issues with was getting the composer to correctly install.
I kept getting a few different errors.  I was able to correct this by installing php-xml.
I did have too much trouble with the dockerfile itself just and to append some of the 
configuration files.

I still have not fully figured out the Jekyl themes or possibly even Jekyl yet.  I am
able to upload my files to my github page but they just appear as normal files.  Bascailly
just text files.  I still need to play around with Jekyl to see if I can figure it out.
