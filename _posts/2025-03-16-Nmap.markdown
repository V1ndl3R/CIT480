Understanding Nmap: A Beginner's Guide
This blog will walk you through getting started with Nmap, the Network Mapper tool. Nmap is one of the most versatile tools for network discovery and security auditing.

Step 1: Install Nmap
Nmap is pre-installed on Kali Linux, but you can install or update it with:

bash
sudo apt install nmap
On other operating systems, download it from the official site: Nmap Downloads.

Step 2: Basic Nmap Scan
Start by scanning a single IP to discover open ports:

bash
nmap <IP address>
For example:

bash
nmap 192.168.1.1

Nmap will list open ports and their associated services.

Step 3: Perform a Range Scan
To scan an entire network, use a range of IPs:

bash
nmap 192.168.1.1-255
This command maps all active devices on the network.

Step 4: Use Nmap with Specific Options
For more detailed scans:

Service Version Detection:

bash
nmap -sV <IP address>
Operating System Detection:

bash
nmap -O <IP address>

Aggressive Scan (Combines multiple options):

bash
nmap -A <IP address>
Step 5: Save Scan Results
To save your results for later use:

bash
nmap -oN output.txt <IP address>
Replace output.txt with your preferred filename.

Conclusion
Nmap is a powerful tool for beginners and professionals alike. Experiment with its features and incorporate it into your security workflows.
