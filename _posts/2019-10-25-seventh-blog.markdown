This week I spent much of my week working on NCL.  Which is National Cyber league, it is a pretty simple competition that focusing on penetration testing.  There are a few different categories like open source where you just need to just need to do some simple web searches to Enumeration and Exploitation which you need to reversive engineer some code.

I have done it for a few years now, I enjoy it.  The only issue I have with it is it is always in the middle of the semester which makes it hard to put to much time into it.  The preseason is fine because you have a whole week so you can plan around it. The individual game is hard because it is only one weekend.  If you have projects or other obligations then it is hard to focus on it.

The challenge that I thought was pretty cool this year was a Exfil one. They give you a packet capture and you have to figure out what flag and who exfiltrated it.  The tricky part was this year it was a tar.gz file that was exfiltrated and you had to find it in the packets.  Once you found it you had to take the hex sting and create a tar.gz file and then untar it to get the flag.  I thought it was pretty cool and it was right in front of me for the longest time.  It took me a few times of looking at it to figure out that was what I needed to do.
