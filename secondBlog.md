I can start to see some of the advantages of using Docker. I am still not completely sold on
it just yet.  But working with it a little more I can see how it has its advantages.  I ended
up just partitioning my hard drive and installing a copy of Kali so that I can still use its 
features.

This week I worked a little bit with creating a dockerfile to make an image.  This would allow
you to be able to create as many containers as quickly as you wanted. This is a very useful
feature and was pretty easy to do.  With the initial lab when I did it step by step the 
only part that I had some issues with was getting the composer to correctly install.
I kept getting a few different errors.  I was able to correct this by installing php-xml.
I did have too much trouble with the dockerfile itself just and to append some of the 
configuration files.

I still have not fully figured out the Jekyl themes or possibly even Jekyl yet.  I am
able to upload my files to my github page but they just appear as normal files.  Bascailly
just text files.  I still need to play around with Jekyl to see if I can figure it out.
